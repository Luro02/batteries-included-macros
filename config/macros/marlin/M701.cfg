# Loads filament into the extruder.
#
# Usage:
#     M701 [L<distance>] [F<feedrate>] [S<travel>]
# Parameters:
# [L<distance>] How much filament should be extruded (purged) in mm, by default 50mm.
# [F<feedrate>] How fast the filament should be purged, by default 3
# [S<travel>] How fast the printer should move, by default 1000
